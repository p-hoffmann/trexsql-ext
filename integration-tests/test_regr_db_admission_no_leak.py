"""Regression test for the admission-controller queue leak (Fix 2).

Failure mode (pre-fix):
  When ``DbQueryTable::bind`` ran the query through
  ``admission::submit_or_check`` and got back ``QueryStatus::Queued``, it
  bailed out with ``Err(format!("Query queued at position {}", ...))`` and
  never called ``admission::cancel_query`` for the qid the controller had
  just allocated. The queue therefore accumulated one orphaned entry per
  rejected-via-Queued ``trex_db_query(...)`` call, and
  ``trex_db_query_status()`` would report queued queries that the engine
  was no longer going to schedule.

Fix:
  ``plugins/db/src/lib.rs`` cancels the qid on the Queued (and Rejected)
  return path before returning Err.

Test plan:
  - Connect over pgwire; load the db extension; turn distributed mode on.
  - Set the per-user admission quota to 1 so that the second concurrent
    submission must Queue.
  - Issue N+1 ``trex_db_query`` calls in quick succession. The queued ones
    return an error string starting with "Query queued at position ...";
    we tolerate either an exception from psycopg or an error column.
  - After the storm settles, assert ``trex_db_query_status()`` does NOT
    list any rows in the ``queued(*)`` state for the user we used. With
    the leak, leftover entries persist for the lifetime of the process.

Skipped automatically if the trex pgwire endpoint is not reachable.
