"""Regression test: trex_runtime (trexas) server start/stop/start lifecycle.

Bug: stop_server only removed the entry from ServerManager and dropped the
JoinHandle from SERVER_THREADS without ever signalling the spawned tokio
runtime to exit. The trex-server thread kept running indefinitely and held
the listening socket, so an immediate restart on the same port would either
fail to bind or race with the previous bind.

Fix: stop_server now sends a TerminationToken cancel (which the
base::server::listen() select! arm awaits as input_termination_token) and
joins the worker thread before returning. SERVER_THREADS cleanup happens
after the thread exits, not before.

This regression test starts a trex_server, stops it, and immediately
re-starts it on the same port. The cycle repeats several times. PASS = no
"address already in use" error and no zombie thread; the second start
returns a fresh server id (not "Error: ...").
