"""Regression test for the Flight-server registry phantom-entry bug (Fix 3).

Failure mode (pre-fix):
  ``flight_server::start_flight_server[_with_tls]`` reserves a slot in the
  ``ServerRegistry`` synchronously and then spawns the listening thread.
  If the thread later fails internally — bind error on a port already in
  use, parse error on an invalid host, runtime build failure, or
  ``serve()`` returning Err — nobody removed the registry entry. The
  registry then reported a phantom server forever via
  ``trex_db_flight_status()``.

Fix:
  The spawned thread holds an RAII ``DeregisterOnDrop`` guard for the
  ``host:port`` it reserved. Any exit path — Ok, Err, panic — drops the
  guard and the registry slot is reclaimed.

Test plan:
  - Connect over pgwire; load the db extension.
  - Snapshot ``trex_db_flight_status()`` so we can compare deltas.
  - Call ``trex_db_flight_start('not a real hostname', 65530)``. The
    address parse fails inside the spawned thread, so the call returns
    success/string at the SQL layer but the thread aborts immediately.
  - Wait briefly for the thread to run + drop the guard.
  - Assert the registry does not list the bogus entry.

The same logic protects port-conflict and bind-error cases; we exercise
the parse-failure path because it is the most reliable to trigger from a
test without colliding with concurrent suites.

Skipped automatically if the trex pgwire endpoint is not reachable.
