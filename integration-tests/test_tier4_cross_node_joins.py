"""Tier 4: Cross-node join and trexsql function tests.

Phase 3 (US1): Tests T018-T022b verify distributed JOIN behaviour via the
legacy coordinator path (distributed_engine=False).  The legacy coordinator
resolves the *first* table in a query, fans the SQL to every node that holds
it, and merges the partial results.  True cross-node joins (table A only on
node 1, table B only on node 2) are NOT supported by the legacy path; those
require the DataFusion distributed engine (see tier 6 tests).

Phase 4 (US2): Tests T026-T029 verify that trexsql-specific functions,
standard aggregations, and complex queries work correctly when routed through
the swarm_query distributed infrastructure.

Phase 5 (US3): Tests T030-T034 verify multi-way joins (3+ tables), CTEs,
and window functions across distributed nodes.

NOTE: These tests use distributed_engine=False (legacy coordinator).  For
DataFusion distributed engine tests, see test_tier6_ballista.py.
