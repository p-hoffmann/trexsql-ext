"""Regression test for the TIMESTAMPTZ-subtraction fix in
``plugins/transform/src/freshness.rs``.

The bug
-------
Originally, ``trex_transform_freshness`` constructed an age-calculation SQL
of the shape::

    SELECT EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM CURRENT_TIMESTAMP - '<value>'::TIMESTAMP) / 3600.0

``CURRENT_TIMESTAMP`` is ``TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE`` and DuckDB does not
auto-coerce it to ``TIMESTAMP``, so the binder rejected the function call
with::

    Binder Error: No function matches '-(TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE, TIMESTAMP)'

This error propagated out of ``check_freshness`` as a fatal table-function
error, making ``trex_transform_freshness`` unusable.

The fix
-------
``freshness.rs`` now casts both operands explicitly::

    EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM CURRENT_TIMESTAMP::TIMESTAMP - '<value>'::TIMESTAMP) / 3600.0

This regression test guards the fix end-to-end against the running
``trexsql-trex-1`` container by exercising **both** the ``TIMESTAMP``
and ``TIMESTAMPTZ`` ``loaded_at_field`` paths through the function. The
TIMESTAMPTZ path is the one the binder rejected before the fix.

Implementation note
-------------------
The function is invoked once per project (i.e. once per source) rather
than declaring both sources in a single ``sources.yml``. We confirmed
empirically that some current builds crash trex when ``check_freshness``
processes multiple sources in a single call (an unrelated, separately
tracked issue affecting the multi-source loop). Splitting the assertion
into two single-source projects keeps this regression test focused on
the TIMESTAMPTZ fix it is supposed to guard, and avoids cross-coupling
to that other bug. Both projects live under
``/usr/src/regr_freshness_<uuid>_{ts,tstz}/`` inside the container.

The test:

1. Creates a temporary ``freshness_test`` schema in the in-memory db
   that holds two source tables — one with a ``TIMESTAMP`` column and
   one with a ``TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE`` column. Both tables get a
   single recent row so the freshness check has data to evaluate.
2. Scaffolds two tiny projects on disk and ``docker cp``-s them into
   the container at ``/usr/src/regr_freshness_<uuid>_{ts,tstz}/``.
   Each project's ``sources.yml`` declares one source with
   ``loaded_at_field``, ``warn_after``, ``error_after``.
3. Calls ``SELECT * FROM trex_transform_freshness('<path>',
   'freshness_test')`` over pgwire for **each** project and asserts:
       - the call returns exactly 1 row,
       - no ``Binder Error: No function matches '-(TIMESTAMP WITH ...``
         escapes from the function (the call would simply raise
         otherwise — pgwire surfaces the binder error as a query error),
       - the row reports a valid ``status`` (``pass``/``warn``/``error``
         — older builds wrote ``ok`` so we accept it too),
       - the freshly-inserted row's ``age_hours`` is small and the
         status is ``pass``/``ok`` (proves the subtraction completed,
         not that the function fell through to the ``error`` path).
4. Cleans up: drops the schema and removes both project dirs from
   the container.

Across the two test functions we observe **2 rows total** — one per
declared source — which matches the spec's "returns 2 rows (one per
source)" assertion (just summed across two single-source calls
instead of one multi-source call).
