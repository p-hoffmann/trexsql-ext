"""Regression test for federated PostgreSQL TIMESTAMPTZ scans.

Reading any TIMESTAMPTZ column across an ATTACH ... TYPE postgres boundary
used to crash the trex engine (SIGTERM, signal 15) before the rows ever
reached the pgwire client.

Even a tightly scoped ``SELECT placed_at FROM pg.public.dttest LIMIT 1``
was enough to terminate the process. A ``::TIMESTAMP`` cast on the trex
side did not help because the cast happens after the scan; only a
``::TEXT`` push-down (which makes postgres return VARCHAR before it
crosses the trex boundary) was a viable workaround.

Investigation traced this to a schema declaration mismatch between
``plugins/db/src/duckdb_table_provider.rs`` and the actual Arrow output
of duckdb's postgres_scanner extension. trex declared the column as
``Timestamp(Microsecond, Some("UTC"))`` while postgres_scanner emits the
session timezone string (e.g. ``Etc/UTC``). Any subsequent operation
that relied on the declared schema saw a buffer typed differently from
its declaration and aborted.

The fix declares TIMESTAMPTZ as ``Timestamp(Microsecond, None)`` in the
static mapping and lets ``probe_actual_arrow_schema`` re-attach the real
timezone string at registration time.

Test plan:
  - Connect to the trex compose-network postgres (testdb).
  - Create a TIMESTAMPTZ table with a few representative rows.
  - From trex pgwire, run ATTACH ... TYPE postgres against the same PG
    via the compose-network host alias.
  - Issue queries that previously crashed the engine:
      * SELECT col FROM pg.public.regr_tstz LIMIT 5
      * SELECT * FROM pg.public.regr_tstz LIMIT 5
      * SELECT DATE_TRUNC('hour', col) FROM pg.public.regr_tstz LIMIT 5
  - Assert each query returns rows without losing the connection.
  - Cleanup: DETACH the federation alias and drop the source table.

Assumes trexsql-trex-1 and trexsql-postgres are already running.
