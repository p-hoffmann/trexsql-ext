"""Regression test for trex_etl_start(... 'cdc_only' ...) shutdown.

Covers the case where cdc_only / copy_and_cdc-mode pipelines used to leave
the registry stuck at state='stopping' indefinitely after a shutdown signal
because the CDC `tokio::select!` shutdown branch only set
`PipelineState::Stopping` and never followed through to `Stopped` (or
`Error`) once the workers actually finished.

The fix lives in plugins/etl/src/etl_start.rs (the CDC branch around the
shutdown_rx select arm): after the shutdown signal arrives, the code now
calls `pipeline.shutdown()` via the shutdown_tx handle, awaits
`pipeline.wait()`, and writes the final `Stopped` (or `set_error()` on
failure) to the registry — twin of the copy_only fix that already lives at
~lines 510-540 of the same file.

Test plan:
  - Spin up an isolated postgres:16 container on the trex compose network
    with logical replication (wal_level=logical) and a CA-signed SSL cert
    so the etl-lib rustls handshake to the source PG succeeds.
  - Place the CA cert at /etc/trexsql/etl_pg_ca.pem inside the trex
    container so etl_start.rs can pick it up.
  - Create a replicator role, a small table, and a publication on the
    source.
  - Call trex_etl_start with mode='cdc_only' against the source via
    pgwire (port 5433).
  - Wait briefly for the pipeline to reach a running state
    (snapshotting/streaming).
  - Call trex_etl_stop(name) — this fires the shutdown channel, which
    triggers the fixed code path. The call must return synchronously
    without hanging (proving wait_fut completed) and must not error.
  - Restart a fresh pipeline with the same name to confirm the registry
    didn't leak the prior entry (a stuck thread would leave a dangling
    handle and either block the new start or fail registration).
  - Always tear down: stop the new pipeline, remove the source container.

Note on assert vs poll: `trex_etl_stop()` removes the registry entry
synchronously before joining the worker thread (see
`pipeline_registry::stop`). That means the visible state via
`trex_etl_status()` after stop is "absent", not "stopped" — so the
correct regression check is: stop returns cleanly within a bounded time
and the registry can accept a fresh start. Without the fix, the worker
thread either hangs in pipeline.start()'s caller scope (workers
orphaned) or returns immediately leaving the registry in a stale state.

Assumes trexsql-trex-1 is already running and reachable on port 5433.

    Twin of the copy_only regression. After stop(), the registry entry is
