"""Regression test for pgwire server restart on the same host:port.

Before the fix in ``plugins/pgwire/src/server_registry.rs``, ``stop_server``
sent the shutdown oneshot and returned without joining the spawned server
thread. The OS hadn't released the listener yet, so a new ``trex_pgwire_start``
on the same ``host:port`` raced the still-shutting-down accept loop and hit
``EADDRINUSE``. In some manifestations the trex process was killed by the
panic propagating out of the spawned tokio runtime, leaving an external
SIGTERM (signal 15) in the container logs.

The fix mirrors the FHIR plugin: ``stop_server`` now removes the registry
entry while briefly holding the lock, drops the lock, sends the shutdown
signal, and joins the thread handle so the port is fully released before
returning.

This test exercises the fix by:
  1. Looping ``trex_pgwire_start`` -> ``trex_pgwire_stop`` 3 times on the
     same port. Without the join, iteration 2's bind would race iteration
     1's still-closing socket; with the join, every cycle succeeds.
  2. After each stop, asserting ``trex_pgwire_status()`` has 0 rows for the
     port — i.e. no dangling registry entry.
  3. Calling ``trex_pgwire_stop`` once more on the no-longer-running server
     and asserting it returns a clean ``No server running`` error rather
     than panicking.
  4. Ending with ``SELECT 1`` heartbeat — if trex SIGTERMed mid-test the
     pgwire connection would be dead and this would raise.

Assumes the docker-compose ``trexsql-trex-1`` container is reachable on the
host's ``localhost:5433`` with seeded ``trex / trex`` credentials.
