# Plugin System Overview

trexsql has a plugin system that extends the management application with custom API endpoints, UI pages, database migrations, and workflow definitions. Plugins are standard NPM packages with a `trex` configuration block in `package.json`.

## Plugin Types

| Type | Purpose | Key |
|------|---------|-----|
| **Function** | HTTP API endpoints via Deno workers | `trex.functions` |
| **UI** | Static frontend assets and navigation items | `trex.ui` |
| **Migration** | SQL schema migrations | `trex.migrations` |
| **Flow** | Prefect workflow deployments | `trex.flow` |

A single plugin can combine multiple types.

## Plugin Discovery

Plugins are scanned from two directories at server startup:

- **`PLUGINS_PATH`** (default: `./plugins`) — production plugins
- **`PLUGINS_DEV_PATH`** (default: `./plugins-dev`) — development plugins (only when `NODE_ENV=development`)

The scanner walks each directory, enters scoped packages (those starting with `@`), and reads `package.json` from each subdirectory. The short name is derived from the package name (e.g., `@trex/my-plugin` becomes `my-plugin`).

## Plugin Installation

Plugins can be installed via SQL using the [tpm extension](../sql-reference/tpm):

```sql
SELECT * FROM trex_plugin_install_with_deps('@trex/my-plugin@1.0.0', './plugins');
```

Or through the MCP API and admin UI.

## Authorization

Plugins can define custom roles and scopes for fine-grained access control:

```json
{
  "trex": {
    "functions": {
      "roles": {
        "my-plugin-admin": ["my-plugin:read", "my-plugin:write"]
      },
      "scopes": [
        { "path": "/plugins/my-plugin/admin/*", "scopes": ["my-plugin:write"] }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

- Roles are auto-created in the `trex.role` database table at startup
- Admin users bypass all scope checks
- Plugin routes are protected by auth context and authorization middleware
